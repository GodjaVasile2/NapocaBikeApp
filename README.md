# Napoca Bike

Napoca Bike is a web application designed to encourage users to adopt two-wheeled transportation and explore the beautiful city of Cluj-Napoca.


## Why?

This web application was developed as my license project, born out of my passion for cycling and my desire to solve a personal challenge.
As an avid cyclist in Cluj-Napoca, I often found myself reluctant to use my bicycle due to the difficulty in finding suitable and secure parking spots. 
Napoca Bike is my solution to this problem


## Usage

The website is composed of several pages, each addressing a specific need:

Locations Page 📍: This page is dedicated to Shops and Services for bicycles, providing a comprehensive list of places where users can purchase or repair their bikes.

Parkings Page 🅿️: The main feature of the website, this page allows users to find the nearest bicycle parking spots. It also provides details about each parking spot, such as its capacity and safety level.

Rentals Page 🚲: This page is specifically for those who wish to rent bicycles through the program provided by the municipality of Cluj-Napoca.

Users are also invited to suggest their own parking spots or locations where bikes can be purchased or repaired. This feature encourages community involvement and ensures the information on the site is up-to-date and relevant. 💡
