# Napoca Bike

Napoca Bike is a web application designed to encourage users to adopt two-wheeled transportation and explore the beautiful city of Cluj-Napoca.


## Why?

This web application was developed as my license project, born out of my passion for cycling and my desire to solve a personal challenge.
As an avid cyclist in Cluj-Napoca, I often found myself reluctant to use my bicycle due to the difficulty in finding suitable and secure parking spots. 
Napoca Bike is my solution to this problem
